Clouds are an important part of Earth's weather.\r\n\r\n### Why cloud?\r\nThe sky can be full of water. But most of the time you can't see the water. The drops of water are too small to see. They have turned into a gas called water vapor. As the water vapor goes higher in the sky, the air gets cooler. The cooler air causes the water droplets to start to stick to things like bits of dust, ice or sea salt.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
